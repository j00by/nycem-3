            <p>
                Red Hook is a waterfront neighborhood significantly impacted by Hurricane Sandy. It has historically
                been an industrial area with a mixed-income residential community.
            </p>
            <p>Since Hurricane Sandy, Red Hook has received substantial investment in resilience infrastructure, such as
                elevated landscapes and revamped building codes, attracting higher-income residents and developers. This
                has led to a surge in property values, displacing long-time residents.

            <p>A narrow peninsula, The Rockaways is prone to storm surges and flooding, highlighted during Hurricane
                Sandy.</p>
            <p>Resilience projects such as beach nourishment and sea wall construction have made The Rockaways more
                appealing to developers. While these projects are critical for protecting the area from future storms,
                they have also led to increased housing prices and interest from outside the community.</p>
            <p><a href="#">"Urban Adaptation and New York City"</a> provides a comprehensive review of adaptation
                strategies across NYC, including The Rockaways, and discusses their implications on local demographics.

            <h3>Lower East Side, Manhattan</h3>
            <p>
                The Lower East Side (LES) is one of Manhattan's most culturally diverse areas, with a significant
                portion of its waterfront vulnerable to flooding.
            </p>
            <p>The East Side Coastal Resiliency Project aims to protect the LES from rising sea levels and storm surges.
                However, these enhancements are driving up property values, making the LES increasingly unaffordable for
                its traditional residents.</p>

                how climate urbanism initiatives, aimed at adapting to or mitigating climate change impacts, can
                inadvertently lead to gentrification, ecological destruction, and a diminishing sense of community in
                urban settings</p>

        <section id="canarsie">
            <h3>Canarsie, Brooklyn</h3>
            <p>
                Canarsie lies in the floodplains of Jamaica Bay and was among the neighborhoods hit hard by Hurricane
                Sandy.
            </p>
            <p>Post-Sandy, flood insurance reforms and rising premiums have disproportionately affected Canarsie's
                long-term residents, many of whom are from minority backgrounds. This financial strain is compounded by
                speculative real estate investments focusing on its "flood-safe" status.</p>
            <p>The New Republic article <a

                    target="_blank">"New York's Invisible Climate Migrants"</a> discusses the slow, economic climate
                retreat from Canarsie, Brooklyn, where residents, impacted by Hurricane Sandy, face challenges such as
                rising flood insurance costs and gentrification, leading some to leave the area</p>

            <h3>Staten Island's East Shore</h3>
            <p>
                The East Shore of Staten Island experienced severe devastation during Hurricane Sandy, leading to a
                significant rethink in terms of urban planning and community safety.
            </p>
            <p>Managed retreat initiatives and resilience building measures post-Sandy have made parts of the East Shore
                particularly attractive for new developments. These projects, while necessary, have altered the
                community fabric, introducing higher-income households and new demographics.</p>

                damage caused by the hurricane through photographs and a timeline, highlighting the significant impact
                on the area including the destruction of homes and businesses, and the loss of electricity and lives</p>
