        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In the face of climate change, cities around the globe are grappling with a trio of interconnected
            phenomena: climate gentrification, migration, and displacement. New York City, with its diverse population
            and complex urban landscape, stands at the forefront of this challenge. As we delve into the intricacies of
            these issues, it's crucial to understand not only their definitions but also their profound implications for
            communities and urban planning.

        <section id="climateGentrification" class="scroll-section">
            <h2>Climate Gentrification</h2>
            <p>Climate Gentrification refers to the phenomenon where neighborhoods less susceptible to climate change
                impacts become more desirable, leading to increased property values and the displacement of lower-income
                residents. This process is significant because it underscores the intersection of climate resilience and
                social inequality. In New York City, this is observed in areas like the Brooklyn waterfront, where
                post-industrial neighborhoods perceived as safer from sea-level rise have seen a surge in development.
                This has led to the displacement of long-standing, lower-income communities, highlighting the need for
                inclusive urban planning.</p>

        <!-- Section for Climate Migration -->
        <section id="climateMigration" class="scroll-section">
            <h2>Climate Migration</h2>
            <p>Climate Migration is the movement of people, either within their country or across borders, driven by
                sudden or gradual changes in their environment due to climate change. This migration is crucial to
                understand because it reflects the direct human impact of climate change. In the context of New York
                City, climate migration manifests through the influx of individuals from regions severely affected by
                climate change, showcasing internal climate migration. This underscores the importance of preparing
                urban areas for the influx of climate migrants.</p>

        <!-- Section for Climate Displacement -->
        <section id="climateDisplacement" class="scroll-section">
            <h2>Climate Displacement</h2>
            <p>Climate Displacement occurs when individuals or communities are forced to leave their homes due to
                climate change-induced environmental changes. This displacement is a critical issue as it highlights the
                urgent need for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. In New York City, the aftermath of
                Hurricane Sandy provided a stark example of climate displacement, with initiatives like the state's
                buyout program in Staten Island's Oakwood Beach. This case illustrates the complex challenges of
                managing climate displacement.</p>
